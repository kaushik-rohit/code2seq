Gets the serializer that recognizes the previous serialization schema of the state.
This is the serializer that should be used for restoring the state, i.e. when the state
is still in the previous serialization schema.

<p>This method only returns a serializer if this provider has the previous serializer's
snapshot. Otherwise, trying to access the previous schema serializer will fail
with an exception.

@return a serializer that reads and writes in the previous schema of the state.
