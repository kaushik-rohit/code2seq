Creates a queue.

<p>Queues created with this method allow tasks to live for a maximum of 31 days. After a task
is 31 days old, the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not.

<p>WARNING: Using this method may have unintended side effects if you are using an App Engine
`queue.yaml` or `queue.xml` file to manage your queues. Read [Overview of Queue Management and
queue.yaml](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/queue-yaml) before using this method.

<p>Sample code:

<pre><code>
try (CloudTasksClient cloudTasksClient = CloudTasksClient.create()) {
LocationName parent = LocationName.of("[PROJECT]", "[LOCATION]");
Queue queue = Queue.newBuilder().build();
Queue response = cloudTasksClient.createQueue(parent.toString(), queue);
}
</code></pre>

@param parent Required.
<p>The location name in which the queue will be created. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID`
<p>The list of allowed locations can be obtained by calling Cloud Tasks' implementation of
[ListLocations][google.cloud.location.Locations.ListLocations].
@param queue Required.
<p>The queue to create.
<p>[Queue's name][google.cloud.tasks.v2.Queue.name] cannot be the same as an existing
queue.
