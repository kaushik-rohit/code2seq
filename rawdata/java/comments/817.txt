Returns a trust manager that trusts {@code certificates} and none other. HTTPS services whose
certificates have not been signed by these certificates will fail with a {@code
SSLHandshakeException}.

<p>This can be used to replace the host platform's built-in trusted certificates with a custom
set. This is useful in development where certificate authority-trusted certificates aren't
available. Or in production, to avoid reliance on third-party certificate authorities.

<p>See also {@link CertificatePinner}, which can limit trusted certificates while still using
the host platform's built-in trust store.

<h3>Warning: Customizing Trusted Certificates is Dangerous!</h3>

<p>Relying on your own trusted certificates limits your server team's ability to update their
TLS certificates. By installing a specific set of trusted certificates, you take on additional
operational complexity and limit your ability to migrate between certificate authorities. Do
not use custom trusted certificates in production without the blessing of your server's TLS
administrator.
