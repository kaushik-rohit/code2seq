Fail the specified allocation and release the corresponding slot if we have one.
This may triggered by JobManager when some slot allocation failed with rpcTimeout.
Or this could be triggered by TaskManager, when it finds out something went wrong with the slot,
and decided to take it back.

@param allocationID Represents the allocation which should be failed
@param cause The cause of the failure
@return Optional task executor if it has no more slots registered
