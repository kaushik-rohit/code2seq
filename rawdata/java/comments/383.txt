Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
proper sequence; the runtime type of the returned array is that of
the specified array.  If the queue fits in the specified array, it
is returned therein.  Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the
runtime type of the specified array and the size of this queue.

<p>Like the {@link #toArray()} method, this method acts as bridge between
array-based and collection-based APIs.  Further, this method allows
precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

Note that {@code toArray(new Object[0])} is identical in function to
{@code toArray()}.

@param destination the array into which the elements of the queue are to
be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
same runtime type is allocated for this purpose
@return an array containing all of the elements in this queue
@throws ArrayStoreException if the runtime type of the specified array
is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
this queue
@throws NullPointerException if the specified array is null
