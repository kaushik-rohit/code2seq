For a given version and type (Iced class simpleName) return an appropriate new Schema object, if any.
<p>
If a higher version is asked for than is available (e.g., if the highest version of
Frame is FrameV2 and the client asks for the schema for (Frame, 17) then an instance
of FrameV2 will be returned.  This compatibility lookup is cached.
@throws H2ONotFoundArgumentException if an appropriate schema is not found
