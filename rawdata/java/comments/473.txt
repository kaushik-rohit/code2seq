Copy from an input stream to a file (and buffer it) and close the input stream.
<p>
It is highly recommended to use FileUtils.retryCopy whenever possible, and not use a raw `InputStream`

@param is   The input stream to copy bytes from. `is` is closed regardless of the copy result.
@param file The file to copy bytes to. Any parent directories are automatically created.

@return The count of bytes written to the file

@throws IOException
