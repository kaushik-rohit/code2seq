Sets eviction policy.

@param evictionPolicy
<p><code>LRU</code> - uses local cache with LRU (least recently used) eviction policy.
<p><code>LFU</code> - uses local cache with LFU (least frequently used) eviction policy.
<p><code>SOFT</code> - uses local cache with soft references. The garbage collector will evict items from the local cache when the JVM is running out of memory.
<p><code>NONE</code> - doesn't use eviction policy, but timeToLive and maxIdleTime params are still working.
