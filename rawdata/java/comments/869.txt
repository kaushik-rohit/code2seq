Gets the kind of the file system from its scheme.

<p>Implementation note: Initially, especially within the Flink 1.3.x line
(in order to not break backwards compatibility), we must only label file systems
as 'inconsistent' or as 'not proper filesystems' if we are sure about it.
Otherwise, we cause regression for example in the performance and cleanup handling
of checkpoints.
For that reason, we initially mark some filesystems as 'eventually consistent' or
as 'object stores', and leave the others as 'consistent file systems'.
