Spark-submit accepts a execution jar or a python file.
This method looks for the proper user execution jar or a python file.
The user input is expected in the following 3 formats:
1. ./lib/abc
2. ./lib/abc.jar
3. ./lib/abc.py

This method will use prefix matching to find any jar/py that is the form of abc*.(jar|py),
so that users can bump jar versions without doing modifications to their Hadoop DSL.

This method will throw an Exception if more than one jar that matches the prefix is found

@param workingDirectory
@param userSpecifiedJarName
@return the resolved actual jar/py file name to execute
