Create a pooled ByteBuf allocator but disables the thread-local cache. Thread-local caches
are disabled for TransportClients because the ByteBufs are allocated by the event loop thread,
but released by the executor thread rather than the event loop thread. Those thread-local
caches actually delay the recycling of buffers, leading to larger memory usage.
