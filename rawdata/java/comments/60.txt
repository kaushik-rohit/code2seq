Changes the {@link Authentication} associated with the current thread to the specified one and returns an
{@link AutoCloseable} that restores the previous security context.

<p>
This makes impersonation much easier within code as it can now be used using the try with resources construct:
<pre>
try (ACLContext ctx = ACL.as(auth)) {
...
}
</pre>
@param auth the new authentication.
@return the previous authentication context
