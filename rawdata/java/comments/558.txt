Creates a new solution set update output collector.

<p>This collector is used by {@link IterationIntermediateTask} or {@link IterationTailTask} to update the
solution set of workset iterations. Depending on the task configuration, either a fast (non-probing)
{@link org.apache.flink.runtime.iterative.io.SolutionSetFastUpdateOutputCollector} or normal (re-probing)
{@link SolutionSetUpdateOutputCollector} is created.

<p>If a non-null delegate is given, the new {@link Collector} will write back to the solution set and also call
collect(T) of the delegate.

@param delegate null -OR- a delegate collector to be called by the newly created collector
@return a new {@link org.apache.flink.runtime.iterative.io.SolutionSetFastUpdateOutputCollector} or
{@link SolutionSetUpdateOutputCollector}
