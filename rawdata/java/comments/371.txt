Sets whether or not circular redirects are allowed.
<p>
Circular redirects happen when a request redirects to itself, or when a same request was already accessed in a chain of
redirects.
<p>
Since 2.5.0, the default is to allow circular redirects.

@param allow {@code true} if circular redirects should be allowed, {@code false} otherwise
@since 2.4.0
