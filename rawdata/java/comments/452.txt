Remove a {@link ByteBuf} from the queue with the specified number of bytes. Any added buffer who's bytes are
fully consumed during removal will have it's promise completed when the passed aggregate {@link ChannelPromise}
completes.

@param bytes the maximum number of readable bytes in the returned {@link ByteBuf}, if {@code bytes} is greater
than {@link #readableBytes} then a buffer of length {@link #readableBytes} is returned.
@param aggregatePromise used to aggregate the promises and listeners for the constituent buffers.
@return a {@link ByteBuf} composed of the enqueued buffers.
