Returns the specified SSL policy resource. Gets a list of available SSL policies by making a
list() request.

<p>Sample code:

<pre><code>
try (SslPolicyClient sslPolicyClient = SslPolicyClient.create()) {
ProjectName project = ProjectName.of("[PROJECT]");
SslPolicy sslPolicyResource = SslPolicy.newBuilder().build();
Operation response = sslPolicyClient.insertSslPolicy(project, sslPolicyResource);
}
</code></pre>

@param project Project ID for this request.
@param sslPolicyResource A SSL policy specifies the server-side support for SSL features. This
can be attached to a TargetHttpsProxy or a TargetSslProxy. This affects connections between
clients and the HTTPS or SSL proxy load balancer. They do not affect the connection between
the load balancers and the backends.
@throws com.google.api.gax.rpc.ApiException if the remote call fails
