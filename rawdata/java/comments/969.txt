Returns true if the authority is properly formatted.  An authority is the combination
of hostname and port.  A <code>null</code> authority value is considered invalid.
Note: this implementation validates the domain unless a RegexValidator was provided.
If a RegexValidator was supplied and it matches, then the authority is regarded
as valid with no further checks, otherwise the method checks against the
AUTHORITY_PATTERN and the DomainValidator (ALLOW_LOCAL_URLS)
@param authority Authority value to validate, alllows IDN
@return true if authority (hostname and port) is valid.
