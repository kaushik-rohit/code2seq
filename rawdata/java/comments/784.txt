Gets the top directories of all the checked out modules.

<p>
Some SCMs support checking out multiple modules inside a workspace, which
creates directory layout like this:

<pre>{@code
workspace  <- workspace root
+- xyz    <- directory checked out by SCM
+- .svn
+- build.xml  <- user file
+- abc    <- second module from different SCM root
+- .svn
+- build.xml  <- user file
}</pre>

This method takes the workspace root as a parameter, and is expected to return
all the module roots that were checked out from SCM.

<p>
For normal SCMs, the array will be of length <code>1</code> and it's contents
will be identical to calling {@link #getModuleRoot(FilePath, AbstractBuild)}.

@param workspace The workspace root directory
@param build
The build for which the module roots are desired.
This parameter is null when existing legacy code calls deprecated {@link #getModuleRoot(FilePath)}.
Handle this situation gracefully if your can, but otherwise you can just fail with an exception, too.

@return An array of all module roots.
