Add the given task to the task slot. This is only possible if there is not already another
task with the same execution attempt id added to the task slot. In this case, the method
returns true. Otherwise the task slot is left unchanged and false is returned.

<p>In case that the task slot state is not active an {@link IllegalStateException} is thrown.
In case that the task's job id and allocation id don't match with the job id and allocation
id for which the task slot has been allocated, an {@link IllegalArgumentException} is thrown.

@param task to be added to the task slot
@throws IllegalStateException if the task slot is not in state active
@return true if the task was added to the task slot; otherwise false
