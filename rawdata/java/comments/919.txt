Apply a list of {@link KryoRegistration} to a Kryo instance. The list of registrations is
assumed to already be a final resolution of all possible registration overwrites.

<p>The registrations are applied in the given order and always specify the registration id as
the next available id in the Kryo instance (providing the id just extra ensures nothing is
overwritten, and isn't strictly required);

@param kryo the Kryo instance to apply the registrations
@param resolvedRegistrations the registrations, which should already be resolved of all possible registration overwrites
