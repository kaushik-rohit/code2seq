Require the subgraph to match the specified predicate for the specified input.<br>
Note that this DOES add the specified input to part of the subgraph<br>
i.e., the subgraph matches if the input matches the predicate, and when returning the SubGraph itself, the
function for this input IS added to the SubGraph
@param inputNum    Input number
@param opPredicate Predicate that the input must match
@return This predicate with the additional requirement added
