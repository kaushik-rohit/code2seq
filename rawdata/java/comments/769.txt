<p>Sets the promise to be notified when all combined futures have finished. If all combined futures succeed,
then the aggregate promise will succeed. If one or more combined futures fails, then the aggregate promise will
fail with the cause of one of the failed futures. If more than one combined future fails, then exactly which
failure will be assigned to the aggregate promise is undefined.</p>

<p>After this method is called, no more futures may be added via the {@link PromiseCombiner#add(Future)} or
{@link PromiseCombiner#addAll(Future[])} methods.</p>

@param aggregatePromise the promise to notify when all combined futures have finished
