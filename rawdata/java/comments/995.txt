Returns an estimate of how many more locally queued tasks are
held by the current worker thread than there are other worker
threads that might steal them.  This value may be useful for
heuristic decisions about whether to fork other tasks. In many
usages of ForkJoinTasks, at steady state, each worker should
aim to maintain a small constant surplus (for example, 3) of
tasks, and to process computations locally if this threshold is
exceeded.

<p>This method may be invoked only from within {@code
ForkJoinPool} computations (as may be determined using method
{@link #inForkJoinPool}).  Attempts to invoke in other contexts
result in exceptions or errors, possibly including {@code
ClassCastException}.

@return the surplus number of tasks, which may be negative
