Generates an OAuth 2.0 access token for a service account.

<p>Sample code:

<pre><code>
try (IamCredentialsClient iamCredentialsClient = IamCredentialsClient.create()) {
ServiceAccountName name = ServiceAccountName.of("[PROJECT]", "[SERVICE_ACCOUNT]");
List&lt;String&gt; delegates = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
List&lt;String&gt; scope = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
Duration lifetime = Duration.newBuilder().build();
GenerateAccessTokenResponse response = iamCredentialsClient.generateAccessToken(name, delegates, scope, lifetime);
}
</code></pre>

@param name The resource name of the service account for which the credentials are requested,
in the following format: `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT_EMAIL_OR_UNIQUEID}`.
@param delegates The sequence of service accounts in a delegation chain. Each service account
must be granted the `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role on its next service account
in the chain. The last service account in the chain must be granted the
`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role on the service account that is specified in the
`name` field of the request.
<p>The delegates must have the following format:
`projects/-/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT_EMAIL_OR_UNIQUEID}`
@param scope Code to identify the scopes to be included in the OAuth 2.0 access token. See
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes for more information. At
least one value required.
@param lifetime The desired lifetime duration of the access token in seconds. Must be set to a
value less than or equal to 3600 (1 hour). If a value is not specified, the token's
lifetime will be set to a default value of one hour.
@throws com.google.api.gax.rpc.ApiException if the remote call fails
