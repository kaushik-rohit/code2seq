must be 1-63 characters long and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must match the
regular expression {@code [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?} which means the first character must be a
lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
