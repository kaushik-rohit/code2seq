This method stores the initial hash table's contents on disk if hash join needs the memory
for further partition processing.
The initial hash table is rebuild before a new secondary input is opened.

For the sake of simplicity we iterate over all in-memory elements and store them in one file.
The file is hashed into memory upon opening a new probe input.
