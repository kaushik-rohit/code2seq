Copy the values of an {@link Iterable} to the target {@link CallStreamObserver} while properly
accounting for outbound flow-control.  After calling this method, {@code target} should no
longer be used.

<p>For clients this method is safe to call inside {@link ClientResponseObserver#beforeStart},
on servers it is safe to call inside the service method implementation.
</p>

@param source of values expressed as an {@link Iterable}.
@param target {@link CallStreamObserver} which accepts values from the source.
