Create a new {@code ServerServiceDefinition} whose {@link ServerCallHandler}s will call
{@code interceptors} before calling the pre-existing {@code ServerCallHandler}. The first
interceptor will have its {@link ServerInterceptor#interceptCall} called first.

@param serviceDef   the service definition for which to intercept all its methods.
@param interceptors array of interceptors to apply to the service.
@return a wrapped version of {@code serviceDef} with the interceptors applied.
