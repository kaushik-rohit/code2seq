Returns a list of paths of Eclipse installations.

The search process works by scanning for each 'source dir' for either an eclipse installation or a folder containing the text returned
by getDirName(). If such a folder is found, this process is applied recursively. On windows, this process is run on each drive letter
which represents a physical hard disk. If the native windows API call to determine these drive letters fails, only 'C:' is checked.
