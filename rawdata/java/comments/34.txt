An output method for the network, with optional clearing of the layer inputs.<br>
Note: most users should use {@link #output(boolean, INDArray...)} or similar methods, unless they are doing
non-standard operations (like providing the input arrays externally)

@param train       If true: output during training. False: output during testing. Affects some things such as
dropout
@param clearInputs If true: clear the input arrays for all layers. False: leave the input arrays as-is - which
can be useful for "external errors" (no output layer) backprop use cases
@param input       Input to the network
@return            Output from the network
