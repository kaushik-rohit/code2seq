Given an {@link org.apache.calcite.rel.core.Aggregate}
and the ordinals of the arguments to a
particular call to an aggregate function, creates a 'select distinct'
relational expression which projects the group columns and those
arguments but nothing else.

<p>For example, given

<blockquote>
<pre>select f0, count(distinct f1), count(distinct f2)
from t group by f0</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and the argument list

<blockquote>{2}</blockquote>

<p>returns

<blockquote>
<pre>select distinct f0, f2 from t</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>sourceOf</code> map is populated with the source of each
column; in this case sourceOf.get(0) = 0, and sourceOf.get(1) = 2.

@param relBuilder Relational expression builder
@param aggregate Aggregate relational expression
@param argList   Ordinals of columns to make distinct
@param filterArg Ordinal of column to filter on, or -1
@param sourceOf  Out parameter, is populated with a map of where each
output field came from
@return Aggregate relational expression which projects the required
columns
