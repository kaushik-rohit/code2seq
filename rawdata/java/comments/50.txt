Executes a DurableLog recovery using data from DurableDataLog. During this process, the following will happen:
1. Metadata will be reset and put into recovery mode.
2. DurableDataLog will be initialized. This will fail if the DurableDataLog has already been initialized.
3. Reads the entire contents of the DurableDataLog, extracts Operations, and updates the Metadata and other
components (via MemoryStateUpdater) based on their contents.
4. Metadata is taken out of recovery mode.

@return The number of Operations recovered.
@throws Exception If an exception occurred. This could be one of the following:
* DataLogWriterNotPrimaryException: If unable to acquire DurableDataLog ownership or the ownership
has been lost in the process.
* DataCorruptionException: If an unrecoverable corruption has been detected with the recovered data.
* SerializationException: If a DataFrame or Operation was unable to be deserialized.
* IOException: If a general IO exception occurred.
