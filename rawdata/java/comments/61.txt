Lists log entries. Use this method to retrieve log entries from Logging. For ways to export log
entries, see [Exporting Logs](/logging/docs/export).

<p>Sample code:

<pre><code>
try (LoggingClient loggingClient = LoggingClient.create()) {
List&lt;String&gt; formattedResourceNames = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
String filter = "";
String orderBy = "";
for (LogEntry element : loggingClient.listLogEntries(formattedResourceNames, filter, orderBy).iterateAll()) {
// doThingsWith(element);
}
}
</code></pre>

@param resourceNames Required. Names of one or more parent resources from which to retrieve log
entries:
<p>"projects/[PROJECT_ID]" "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]"
"billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]" "folders/[FOLDER_ID]"
<p>Projects listed in the `project_ids` field are added to this list.
@param filter Optional. A filter that chooses which log entries to return. See [Advanced Logs
Filters](/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters). Only log entries that match the filter are
returned. An empty filter matches all log entries in the resources listed in
`resource_names`. Referencing a parent resource that is not listed in `resource_names` will
cause the filter to return no results. The maximum length of the filter is 20000
characters.
@param orderBy Optional. How the results should be sorted. Presently, the only permitted values
are `"timestamp asc"` (default) and `"timestamp desc"`. The first option returns entries in
order of increasing values of `LogEntry.timestamp` (oldest first), and the second option
returns entries in order of decreasing timestamps (newest first). Entries with equal
timestamps are returned in order of their `insert_id` values.
@throws com.google.api.gax.rpc.ApiException if the remote call fails
