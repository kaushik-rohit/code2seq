Given all the servers, keep only a stable subset of servers to use. This method
keeps the current list of subset in use and keep returning the same list, with exceptions
to relatively unhealthy servers, which are defined as the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Servers with their concurrent connection count exceeding the client configuration for
{@code <clientName>.<nameSpace>.ServerListSubsetFilter.eliminationConnectionThresold} (default is 0)
<li>Servers with their failure count exceeding the client configuration for
{@code <clientName>.<nameSpace>.ServerListSubsetFilter.eliminationFailureThresold}  (default is 0)
<li>If the servers evicted above is less than the forced eviction percentage as defined by client configuration
{@code <clientName>.<nameSpace>.ServerListSubsetFilter.forceEliminatePercent} (default is 10%, or 0.1), the
remaining servers will be sorted by their health status and servers will worst health status will be
forced evicted.
</ul>
<p>
After the elimination, new servers will be randomly chosen from all servers pool to keep the
number of the subset unchanged.
