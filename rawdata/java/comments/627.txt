Tells this vertex to strictly co locate its subtasks with the subtasks of the given vertex.
Strict co-location implies that the n'th subtask of this vertex will run on the same parallel computing
instance (TaskManager) as the n'th subtask of the given vertex.

NOTE: Co-location is only possible between vertices in a slot sharing group.

NOTE: This vertex must (transitively) depend on the vertex to be co-located with. That means that the
respective vertex must be a (transitive) input of this vertex.

@param strictlyCoLocatedWith The vertex whose subtasks to co-locate this vertex's subtasks with.

@throws IllegalArgumentException Thrown, if this vertex and the vertex to co-locate with are not in a common
slot sharing group.
