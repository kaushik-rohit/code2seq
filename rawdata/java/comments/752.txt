<p>Sample code:

<pre><code>
try (NetworkClient networkClient = NetworkClient.create()) {
ProjectGlobalNetworkName network = ProjectGlobalNetworkName.of("[PROJECT]", "[NETWORK]");
Network networkResource = Network.newBuilder().build();
List&lt;String&gt; fieldMask = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
Operation response = networkClient.patchNetwork(network, networkResource, fieldMask);
}
</code></pre>

@param network Name of the network to update.
@param networkResource Represents a Network resource. Read Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network
Overview for more information. (== resource_for v1.networks ==) (== resource_for
beta.networks ==)
@param fieldMask The fields that should be serialized (even if they have empty values). If the
containing message object has a non-null fieldmask, then all the fields in the field mask
(and only those fields in the field mask) will be serialized. If the containing object does
not have a fieldmask, then only non-empty fields will be serialized.
@throws com.google.api.gax.rpc.ApiException if the remote call fails
