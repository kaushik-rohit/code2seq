Checks if the given principal has the permission to create views within the specified view group.
<p>
Note that {@link #SYSTEM} can be passed in as the authentication parameter,
in which case you should probably just assume it can create anything anywhere.
@param a the principal.
@param c the container of the view.
@param d the descriptor of the view to be created.
@return false
if the user doesn't have the permission.
