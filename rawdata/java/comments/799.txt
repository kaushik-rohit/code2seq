Mark the specified variable as a loss function variable. This means that this variable will be minimized via backprop during training.<br>
This will add the variable as a loss to any others - i.e., if multiple variables are marked as losses, their values will be summed
to give the total network loss.<br>
Note that only floating point (Float16/32/64) variables may be marked as a loss.<br>
Note also that only ARRAY type SDVariables can be marked as losses to be minimized. That is, we cannot mark the value
of a constant, variable or placeholder to be minimized as doing so would not make sense.<br>
