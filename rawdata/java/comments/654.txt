Set the list of choices. Legal arguments are String (in which case the arguments gets split into lines) and Collection
which sets the list of legal parameters to the String representations of the argument's non-null entries.

See JENKINS-26143 for background.

This retains the compatibility with the legacy String 'choices' parameter, while supporting the list type as generated
by the snippet generator.

@param choices String or Collection representing this parameter definition's possible values.
