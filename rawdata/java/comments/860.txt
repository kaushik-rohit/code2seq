Returns {@link TypeInformation} about the operands of the evaluation method with a given
signature.

<p>In order to perform operand type inference in SQL (especially when <code>NULL</code> is
used) it might be necessary to determine the parameter {@link TypeInformation} of an
evaluation method. By default Flink's type extraction facilities are used for this but might
be wrong for more complex, custom, or composite types.

@param signature signature of the method the operand types need to be determined
@return {@link TypeInformation} of operand types
