Servo will flatten metric names as: getServoTypeTag()_getServoInstanceTag()_monitorName

An implementation note.  If there's a version mismatch between hystrix-core and hystrix-servo-metric-publisher,
the code below may reference a HystrixEventType.Collapser that does not exist in hystrix-core.  If this happens,
a j.l.NoSuchFieldError occurs.  Since this data is not being generated by hystrix-core, it's safe to count it as 0
and we should log an error to get users to update their dependency set.
