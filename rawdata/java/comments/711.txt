Blocks until the rebalance interval. This wait serves multiple purposes:
-- Ensure rebalance does not happen in quick succession since its a costly cluster level operation.
-- Clubs multiple host events into one to reduce rebalance operations. For example:
Fresh cluster start, cluster/multi-host/host restarts, etc.
