Normal merge: Match PR's commit sha's with commit list
Squash merge: Match PR's merge sha's with commit list
Rebase merge: Match PR's commit's "message"+"author name"+"date" with commit list
<p>
If match found, set the commit's PR number and possibly set the PR merge type
<p>
For setting type:
If PR commit's SHAs are all found in commit stream, then the commit for the merge sha is a merge commit.
In all other cases it is a new commit
