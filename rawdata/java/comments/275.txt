Create a wrapper object around an HLL sketch contained within a buffer. The position and limit of
the buffer may be changed; if you do not want this to happen, you can duplicate the buffer before
passing it in.

The mark and byte order of the buffer will not be modified.

@param buffer buffer containing an HLL sketch starting at its position and ending at its limit

@return HLLC wrapper object
