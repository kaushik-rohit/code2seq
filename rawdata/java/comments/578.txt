Starts a Spark application.

<p>
Applications launched by this launcher run as child processes. The child's stdout and stderr
are merged and written to a logger (see <code>java.util.logging</code>) only if redirection
has not otherwise been configured on this <code>SparkLauncher</code>. The logger's name can be
defined by setting {@link #CHILD_PROCESS_LOGGER_NAME} in the app's configuration. If that
option is not set, the code will try to derive a name from the application's name or main
class / script file. If those cannot be determined, an internal, unique name will be used.
In all cases, the logger name will start with "org.apache.spark.launcher.app", to fit more
easily into the configuration of commonly-used logging systems.

@param listeners Listeners to add to the handle before the app is launched.
